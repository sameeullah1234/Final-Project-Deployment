Clumsy app. Not very user friendly,0.362
absolute disaster! nothing is working properly and each new update is getting worse and worse. Shame! I must go to regular facebook app to take care of my buisness. Lots of bugs!,0.328
"I'm not sure what changed with this app, but I can no longer read messages coming through. It's incredibly inconvenient.",0.328
"Seriously, how does this app keep getting worse and worse?? Everything glitches, it lags so bad, doesn't load images, doesn't save changes you made to pages sometimes,etc. It just sucks. It's so so bad I get so frustrated with it! I wish you guys could just figure out how to stop messing around with apps and just fix them. You haven't had a good update for Facebook in years, I guess we were destined for that with this app as well",0.327
"Terrible app, it's worthless to have when I can't perform any task on it. This app is seriously bugged and I refuse to pay to put ads through this when they can't even fix the small problems.",0.326
why ask something went wrong when i put my contact details. not telling about where i mistake. plz solve this problem,0.324
Poor. Posts section doesn't show post history. Messages aren't shown in phone notifications. Always miss messages from clients. Big disappointment.,0.32
struggling to post updates from my mobile,0.318
Constant crashing and very unfriendly to use.,0.318
delay info and notif not responding..,0.315
it's very helpful but very difficult to navigate,0.314
A terrible app that you unfortunately need. You either get no notifications or get the same notification over and over again even after you have cleared it. Very annoying. Locked account for no reason.,0.312
Need update show network problem any time,0.31
no stable the app function,0.297
"It has no dark mode option, hurts the eyes after a while, specially in the dark",0.29
Not many good features according to me,0.286
Very bad experience with this new updated version when upload a post no time shown on this app.,0.285
Hard to use. Not clear how to post Reels in IG,0.285
"Fails to upload for scheduled posts, messes up timing for scheduled posts, force stops all the time, layout is terrible. Come on.",0.283
App doesn't work anymore?? Now online version of my business page won't allow me to schedule future posts for the holiday?!! Facebook is a mess. Too many updates... useless items.. stop with the endless updates!!! Nothing works currently. Good work!!,0.281
"Useful for quick overview, but refreshing or synchronization of messages doesn't work well and it's really annoying.",0.28
It has stopped editing my products,0.275

Easy to use. There are some errors with posting. No links to Facebook.,0.263
promote your business with ad isn't free,0.262
"Incredibly buggy. Currently it seems entirely broken. I can't view post likes, usually it just says ""can't load"" or ""retry"". I'm forced back onto desktop now to manage pages",0.259
"i dont know why my page manager not working properly, always internet problem, and also no sms.",0.259
"It's nice for answering messages and tracking comments, but not great for responding to those comments. And 9 times out of 10, when I try to make a post from the app, it fails. Pretty useless overall!",0.256
really hard to navigate can't change the photos can't just promote a bad got to go through with the difficult way,0.253
When i opne Instagram insight crash and app get close,0.252
not much easier as it was as page,0.25
"I had lots of problems with pages manager. But so many more problems with business suite. If I wasn't already set up here, I would definitely look for something different. Horrible. Changed from pages manager to business suite. Still having problems. Keep reporting, but never fixed.",0.248
The time stamps are now missing. App feels like it's falling apart,0.248
"This app does my head in, but is 'required' to access page messages. 🙄 1. Messages constantly fail to expand to read the full message. 2. Constant notifications about there being unread messages, but when I go into check messages there are no missed messages & all have been responded to. 3. EXTREMELY DIFFICULT to switch from responding as your page to profile or switching from 1 page to another. Hate it.",0.247
Notifications is not working. I can't view my notifications via Business Suite or Facebook. WTH?,0.241
notifications for messages seem to be extremely delayed,0.239
There is no option to edit/crop photo And no option for shedule post upto 180 daysh,0.239

This newer version makes it more difficult to post events. Hard to include photos and description,0.23
Very bad and missing options for android but it is better in ios,0.23
"I used to love this app, but lately it's been really lagging with messages and not showing messages at all. To add insult to injury, the app is giving me a bad rating on timely responses when I can even get to them. It's costing me top rating, please fix it. I use it daily so I'd miss it if it were gone altogether.",0.228
"I do not like the update as it makes it difficult to even upload a post. Now, I cannot even open the app without it claiming a network error. Definitely isn't a user error as I have tried both on and off wifi.",0.224
This is simply awful. The notifications come up with this weird logo that has nothing to do with Facebook.,0.223
"Update is not Good, It hide timing of Post's..",0.22
It's hard to work at times...,0.219
I can't do have the stuff through the Facebook website . Useless app.,0.219
This app has no functionality. Its not good for aphone at all. I can't even edit my page. Trash app.,0.213
"Pretty terrible in just about every way possible. From notifications that don't update, my unread message count is never 0 even though I've read and responded to all messages, posts won't display previews, the UI is a confusing mess, just terrible all around.",0.213
"Used to work pretty well for scheduling appointments and updating business stuff all in one place, but this new version isn't great. Appointments don't show up right and isn't giving my customers their reminders. I'd prefer the old version back cause this one is bad.",0.212
this app is buggy and finicky - not my favorite - but sort of forced into using it for 'streamlined' posts... expect a little hassle - but it'll work,0.212
Chat messages appear with (sometimes hours of) delay. No dark mode. Unable to view who liked posts.,0.211
stops working if not used for a while,0.211
"This app sucks but it's very handy to be able to run your business through here, even though every single update makes it worse.",0.211
App is glitchy and works horribly. I'm not sure how they thought this would help business owners in anyway. The platforms it posts too are different and don't play nice either. Certain posts will only work on one platform or the other. The app is more annoying than anything else.,0.21
it doesn't always open and work the way it's suppose to :(,0.209
ugh! it's too messy. it needs to be more streamline and easier to use. I might as well just use Facebook.,0.209
"Can No Longer see notifications. going to have to get something doneHas glitches, had to uninstall and reinstall. Has gotten worse! Won't show all comments, messages sometimes takes day to show up. Shows old comments that have been looked at, as new and needing attention. Piss poor.",0.209
great but having problems with Automated messages and Connecting my page with Instagram,0.208
I liked page manager so much better. Not sure why they changed it. This app has to many problems and doesn't seem like it's helping my business at all. To many complaints to list them all.,0.207
"Very buggy, missing facebook features, app inexplicably crops photos without telling you - and displays full photo during preview. Buggy. The interface is a nightmare. It's really bad.",0.207
"When you receive a message on your Facebook page, you can not access it. This has been an ongoing problem. Please fix this problem!",0.203
Doesn't work.... it auto resized photos. Doesn't work as a post scheduler like it should. Waste of time very frustrating. Make no sense does too much instead of letting the user decide how to format thing,0.202
This separate app is stupid. I can't even complete my event post without having to go back to the regular Facebook page to categorize it. Pretty disappointing.,0.201
very difficult to add photos to an album. you have to go through a dozen weird back way to do it.,0.2
This app keeps getting worse. I have messages that I have no idea how to access...I keep getting a pop up when I click on it. There is no message....this app is a terrible idea. It was easier to manage a page before Since the update my private messages keep disappearing,0.199
"ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE!!! I can't even invite guest to my event. The invite button is just gone. You can't schedule post. It moves slowly, has very little use, and doesn't notify you on time when you receive business messages. It also makes me verify my account with an emailed code everytime I log in even though I selected, ""remember this browser."" There is so much more I could say, but I'll stop at TERRIBLE.",0.198
I created 3 posts today and scheduled them and not a single one posted. How disappointing.,0.198
"Why are the notifications not working?!!! This is beyond unacceptable. If you can't fix it, at least give us the option to go back to Page Manager. Ridiculous.",0.197
Takes upto 24 hrs to receive notifications. Constant error messages. Unless app,0.197
"This app sucks. It barely ever loads, it's complicated on mobile to edit events, send invites etc.. Facebook everything is pretty sucky",0.196
no comment because this app I don't know how to use,0.196
Frustrating when I don't get messages until over 24hrs after the customer sent it.,0.195
pictures cant get zoomed in. doesnt notify new messages sometimes. inconvenient,0.194
it's OK but there are UX screwups like asking me to install the new version each time I click on one of my 8 or so different pages. Clicking the tiny 5px wide X in the top corner repeatedly is really annoying. I can install it later - no need to harass someone to install it over their 4G data connection.,0.194
I don't like how you can't delete appointments after they pasted I put the wrong date and didn't realize intill after the date and time passed,0.191
U can't see who like ur post ... it's getting backwards,0.19
This thing is all messed up. Page manager was so much better. We miss out on many people that's trying to get in contact with us. Please fix this because it's absolutely horrible.,0.189
Crashes constantly making it hard to use,0.189
"This app is always broken, it freezes, doesn't upload things, and only shows posts from July or earlier, when i post every week. If you can, just use a computer because the AP is useless.",0.189
"Every update makes this platform a little bit worse. Keep it simple, stupid. My account has been locked for days and there is zero support to fix it",0.189
"So glitchy, it's more trouble than it's worth to even run a Facebook Page.",0.188
"Facebook is trying to make things easier, but really they are more difficult, especially with albums.",0.188
Used to be good but this last 12 months it has only gotten worse and harder to use by the day! Sucks when you have multiple business pages to manage and have invested tens of thousands of dollars into advertising over the years to gain over 10k followers on multiple pages and then you have struggle every day with a horrible app that used to be great...,0.188
this is so much more difficult to navigate than the original Facebook interface.,0.187
Page Mgr. much better. SUCKS! This limits text characters. Won't take as many characters as Facebook!! Improving...,0.187
"BEYOND TERRIBLE, and constantly going from bad to worse! Ever since Page Manager changed to this things have been awful. Can no longer view visitor posts in Business Suite, forcing me to have to constantly go back and forth between it and Facebook. With latest ""updates"", you can't view text in shared posts or extended text in my own posts (can only see included images, videos) and now the stamp showing when a post was shared/submitted has disappeared. PLEASE FIX OR BRING BACK PAGES MANAGER!!!!!!",0.187
A bit different & difficult. The simplicity of the other app is what I prefer.,0.185
"12-5-21 Photos had been fixed, thank you, but more bugs experienced. Date & times are not on posts. I can not share albums from the app, can't see reviews, won't let me see who liked or commented on a post. 9-30-2020 THIS NEW UPDATE IS TERRIBLE!!!! I HATE IT because: There's no way to upload to albums or even get to your albums. You can't even see your page likes count or followers count. The icons are confusing and is literally a jumbled mess!",0.184
"This was created by someone who has never ran a page on Facebook, or by someone who hates its users. The old pages manager app was so much better. This is half thought through, outright broken in places, and is genuinely miserable.",0.183
"I like that I can schedule a post in this app, but what annoys me is the delay notifications of messages. It wont appear in inbox you need to wait and refresh few times",0.183
"not the best, sometimes I don't get notifications until I open the app. it's also not good for seeing new followers. once you ""promote"" stuff nobody sees your normal stuff.",0.182
Useful but buggy. They recently have taken away a feature I felt was most useful. I can no longer ban trolls from a alternate account connected to my business. This needs to be brought back immediately! If a troll blocks your business your left defenceless for the next time they decide to unblock you. Or the same rules need to apply when unblocking someone on normal accounts so I have a period of time to ban them. Getting messages that are not exactly reportable to AI stndard isn't helping.,0.181
fix the bugs with the booking please!! I have to trick it and its super annoying,0.18
"The app is average but Business Suite's a dog at the best of times. It's a necessary evil, but wouldn't use it if I didn't have to.",0.18
I'm not a fan of this. I can't even find pictures I've uploaded over the last several years. It is not easy to navigate.,0.179
"Every update makes this app worse! So frustrating! Now post show no details or heading when you try to click on them. Continuously force closes. Videos won't play after posting them. Plus several other issues and bugs. 8 months ago this app was great! Leave it to Facebook and their amazing team to ""update"" it into the ground.",0.179

"In general, this app is well-designed and organized. My complaint is that it isn't responsive to activity on my Facebook page. For instance, it doesn't log shares of posts well... even though there is a tab for it. I get notified that my new post is being shared and total new shares are listed but the shares I can view are from posts a month ago... doesn't help me engage new audiences well.",0.177
tout moun se viv boko ginen ponyete la,0.176
OK when it works right. But sometimes completely losses posts somewhere. Leaving the person posting to redo them completely.,0.174
"This app is absolute trash! Give us Pages Manager back! Trying to make posts with photos, or upload photos to albums is terribly clunky and throws uploads into the wrong places. It's a nightmare for a page that keeps photos organized!",0.17
"Works decent enough, but competes with the actual Facebook app for priority and can make things difficult.",0.169
The last update was a disaster. I can't see others comments made on business photos. I have to go to my personal page to see them. It also doesn't notify me of messages received that need attention. It's really frustrating now.,0.168
"Each update is progressively worse. I have lost timestamps on messages then today lost them on posts. Can't see post contents, have to leave Business Suite, go to regular Facebook read post then back to BS to post to page. So much better when it was Pages.",0.168
"Downgraded to 1 star. Try opening App and it tells me ""Application does not have Permission for this action"" WHAT action, Open?? All permissions are active. Fails to open, useless 😡😡",0.167
When I want to share post in groups it does not share in groups just cancelled Kindly resolve this problem,0.167
"I LOVE this app, lets me manage all my apps in one place. BUT, sometimes when I'm Trying to get it to open it gives me the error page like the pages aren't there. I may be paranoid, but I feel like my security isn't safe. Been using Facebook since the day it became public. I know lots of things have changed and are still being worked on. I just don't want to lose anymore of my pages, I already lost 1 page because of a Facebook error.",0.167
More complicated to use now and the delete album option is missing,0.167
"I have tried repeatedly to create a post with a picture and I just keep getting the same error. This is ridiculous, who has time to try 20 plus times. Ughhhh",0.166
"Not in love with the business suite, it's difficult to get pictures to fit just right into the posts so they can be viewed properly on both FB and Instagram",0.166
"The layout is messy and the app is generally quite glitchy. Icons and various links don't appear fully and text sometimes disappears, including dates and times of messages and posts. The app also hides the text of your post if you've included an image with it, which isn't helpful.",0.166
We cannot make an assigned chat from mobile and thats bad for business i hope you fix it,0.164
I have problem to Unstol app in playing store move the blog from google Wabsite,0.164
perfect aside from it always kills the quality of photos. any high res photos of my service menu I upload gets turned to a pixelated nightmare no one can read. Notifications are also hit or miss and them not appearing makes it possible to miss clientele reaching out.,0.164

Pages manager was much easier. This is difficult to keep up with.,0.163
I always have problems with the notifications and when I tried to schedule a post it never posted.,0.162
"2nd UPDATE: Ok, so apparently, I spoke too soon. FB has restored the ""like"" feature, but now, as others have mentioned, I don't appear to be getting all of my comments. The inconsistency of this app is concerning. UPATE: So, Facebook has finally replaced the ""Like"" feature to this app. THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!😁 Uuuh...Facebook, this update is not the business. I can no longer like my followers' comments. That's a big NO NO. Please rectify the problem.",0.16
"the app used to be easier to use, now it's sort of a mess trying to add IG to it. I no longer enjoy using the app.",0.156
"I really like our business page on Facebook! I really wish that Facebook would make it easier to cancel an accidental page boost. It happened once when I accidentally touched the boost button. Without my permission it linked my Facebook business page to my email, to my PayPal account, to my personal bank account on file with PayPal and charged my account. I had to go in to the settings and finally stop it. It was quite stressful and disturbing to see just how easy it was for that to happen.",0.156
March: haven't been able to switch pages. Your little icon in the corner is broken. Been broken for 3 months and can't switch pages. I have 9 pages and I'm stuck on one. Why refuse to fix this? April: Still broken. Facebook's developers clearly aren't actually working but screwing around and collecting a paycheck May: Cannot log in. Seriously? You're paying people to run this app? This is an absolute joke of a program,0.155
"I really like the page manager but it does have alot of glitches. It messed up my facebook, can't load pictures anymore, and my messages are all screwed up. Had to delete both and re download facebook to even get it to work and it is still messed up some. Really wish you can get the glitches out.",0.154
"I cannot create new events. Super frustrating. Delays in updates and messages too. I do LOVE the schedule post feature, when it works.",0.154
"This app kind of sucks. I'll make a post and it won't post it and then it's gone. So, I have to retype the whole thing again and it's a waste of time a lot of times.",0.153
"I hate it. I just want to see my business page feed like a regular feed and interact with others as usual, just under my business name. This app really wants to complicate my life. I hate it so much it gives me energy.",0.153
"Most of the time it works well. Sometimes I can't update my business hours, and that's frustrating",0.153
I try opening my posts tab so I can access my photos to place photos in certain folders and it just keeps closing out. WTH,0.152
Page buttons removed. Then I can't use the app to add them back. Just loads endlessly. Facebook is broken. Microsoft word did the same thing back in the day. People who were not focused on user experience kept adding to it until it became an awful tool that people hated.. same thing here. They keep adding features with no guarantee that they work.,0.151
"8 days now, no activity on my manager page. And notifications on my Facebook back goes blank when I click on post likes on my 2 manager pages. Help. If your not going to fix this problem, let me know and I will stop reporting it?",0.15
Please inhance notif of our pages. It can show nega respond to our clients. For the delay notif. Why isnt working well now adays.,0.15
"Welcome to the socialist network. Not user friendly is an understatement. Difficult to engage followers, posts needing approval should also direct you via a click vs instructions. Facebook openly limits organic followers from seeing posts unless you pay to advertise. They'll also openly limit your ads if they decide your views don't fit their agenda. This app is as worthless as the rest of their apps.",0.15

"This app continues to be a big disappointment. Today, for instance I opened it and was unable to schedule any posts. This is very disappointing because I use this for client work. Please explain why this is happening and when it will be fixed!",0.15
Barely works. Can't see notifications or activity. Can't comment or see others profiles. This app is basically useless. Please give me something that works. I'll pay for it!!,0.149
Messaging really needs to be updated. We are losing a lot of money because of the glitching.,0.148
So extremely tired with the app trying to schedule posts instead of actually leaving my setting to post automatically. Fix it.,0.148
"Inbox messages doesn't work anymore, keep saying ""Something went wrong, please try again"". This is very serious issue since I can't communicate with customers or even read old messages...😤",0.147
Overall easy to use. It's great to have metrics to follow trends and activities on your page. The only negative is sometimes there are issues responding to messages. Not the best when it comes to the customer experience.,0.147
"I guess I don't mind the app (I liked Pages better) but ever since the recent update a few days ago (for Android), now my notifications won't load at all and when I click to try and see who has liked a post to invite them to my page, literally nothing appears and nothing loads. Ugh so frustrating!! As of 10/7/21, this is still a problem and hasn't been fixed. Please update this!!! 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏",0.147
"You really had a great idea but the lack of improvement makes this app useless half the time. This is now my 3rd or 4th update on my review. At this point, I am having trouble uploading pictures for my business. If it's anything over 1 picture it fails. Aside from that I'm still not getting messages. I get the notification, but it's not there for a few hours. Is there anyway you can actually read my review and attempt to resolve these issues?",0.145
"I like it, but it runs slow and often photos will not post which makes business a little difficult.",0.144
I love this app its easy to use. Update this was back in 2013 I loved it then not so much now wish it would go back to being Facebook pages it was so much easier to use and I did not have to open my internet to find my spam folder witch I accidentally sent a conversation to and can't figure out how to recover it from the spam folder it's just a pain to work with.,0.143
"Great app; However, no matter what I do, I can no longer receive notifications for comments/messages. I have to log in several times daily just to check for them. Bit of an inconvenience. Would be great if this could be fixed.",0.143
"I use a tablet many times for writing blogposts and updating my page, but there is no setting that will let me use Business Suite in landscape mode. This is very inconvenient as I use my tablet as a laptop more often than not.",0.143
"I used to love using this app for posting and keeping up on pages for which I am an admin. But, the more it updates, the worse it gets! One of my biggest complaints is that when I see the comments on posts, it doesn't show what the post is that they are commenting on. I find it very difficult to locate, see, and edit posts. I wish that I could bring back an earlier version.",0.141
"Update- now appts don't work, but other features do. Like others have said, nothing was working right or consistently. No business messages, no appointment list, unable to post pics in albums. The Facebook app has always been horribly inconsistent about business notifications, and NEVER notifies me of business messages. The only working function that was useful was the post scheduler. I still found myself doubting it would work, so I was always checking to be sure it actually posted correctly.",0.141
"I find it very all overvthe pkace and hard to locate what i'm looking for i..e i get a notifiction i have a messsge, find and read medsage leave the app but still shows i have an unread message, the one i have just read. Annoying",0.14
This app used to be OK for what I needed it for. Then all of the sudden no way to schedule appointments anymore. This is the most frustrating part. The developers are adding things like services to appointments instead of actually fixing the bugs to allow you to even make those appointments with services. It's frustrating when there is more then one person using the app because we are now constantly overbooking because we can't create a schedule. PLEASE FIX THE ISSUES.,0.14
So far not good. Keeps saying I have messages and I check over n over but still nothing. I'm tired of it. This is a useless app. NOBODY INSTALL PLEASE. STAY WITH REGULAR FACEBOOK!!!!!!!,0.139
"Lol yeah this isn't ready for public use yet. Error messages everywhere, eyesore UI, riddled with bugs. Better off just using the main Facebook app for now",0.139
MAK worked on my 2002 Dodge Ram 1500 pickup truck for me. I needed front brakes and front rotors & ac leak and charge. He did an amazing job on my brake job. He installed the pads and rotors for me and he did a professional job on them. The truck stops smooth and the brakes respond quick and no sound at all like I was having because of the low brake pads. He is also did an ac leak check for me and found a valve stem was loose. He vacuumed all the Freon out of the system repaired the leak. Reggie,0.139
Frustrating because I don't get consistent message notifications anymore and have been having issues with booking appointments for the past few weeks!,0.138
Worst business experience ever Without any alerte nor justification they closed the page having a running adds The closed the page and closed the chat support,0.138
This is the only app I can use to manage my business page and it never notifies me of messages until like 6 hours later hurting my response time and making me lose customers. I'm wasting money on Facebook ads because I'm not able to reply in time unless I just watch the app 24/7,0.138
I find it difficult at times to find the notifications. Then ensuring a post actually posts to both Facebook and Instagram. Unless your already a social media guru this can be irritating. I do love the delay post for later feature so I can schedule out posts in advance for a day or two.,0.137
This app works well and is handy for quick posts. My only complaint is I can't find the item that has set the notification so it can't be cleared easily. It's probably a keyboard-to-ground error but I have chased too many notifications on the app.,0.137
Doesnt load messages or it doesnt load ALL the message. I dont get notifications like i should be whuch makes me miss potential clients.

Navigating through the site to edit ANYTHING is just a waste of time and when you do figure it out no one who views your page can find anything.,0.137

"After recent updates, the app will no longer allow me to open my own business sites an answer customer questions, it says I no longer have permission to do this",0.136
This app is getting worse and worse. I am not receiving notifications. If I do not check it consistently I wouldn't know I received a message from a costumer. I have miss several important messages because of it. You can not interact properly with people who like your post. Is impacting more my business than helping.,0.136

As of yesterday my push notifications are no longer coming thru my phone. I have to open the app to check for my messages. Instagram direct also no longer comes through. I never had any issues until yesterday!!!,0.134
"Please fix the bugs in this app! Why do posts fail to upload randomly? And why will it not work for weeks and months at a time? I've cleared cache, Uninstalled and reinstalled, searched the web trying to find a fix for the issues I've been having (there's no answers out there). Then it magically starts working again, only to be disappointed later when it decides to stop working. Seriously fb, get it together and fix this. If you are going to force us to use it, make sure it works correctly!",0.134
awful interface. posts hardly EVER go though. extremely difficult to use. have tried to posts simple hours of operation updates and post never posts. it seems that when I use the business suite nothing posts. I do not have the Facebook app on my phone and feel as though I am being forced to use that OR boost my posts though Facebook ads. I sit here and wonder what the heck is the point of this app....it must be to frustrate business owners,0.133
I can't even upload photos from the app because it won't let me give permission to access my photos through the app. I even tried allowing permissions in my phone's app settings but it's still blocked. The app is useless to me except to edit posts I create on the desktop. This stinks! My app is fully updated and my phone is a newer one.,0.133
App will not allow login. No one will reply about issue.,0.133
"Worst app ever made on earth,,I just activated a 2 step authentication for my business page and when I comfirm with the pin and my password they keep taking me back to square zero, can't use my business page again right now just because of that matter,, and when I turn it of nothing is working, tried a million times now and tired...I regret turning on the 2 step authentication and mostly I hate this so called business suit now",0.132
"ok, so some of the options just take you to the main facebook app. make it more versatile, maybe even add features you cant access on the main facebook. hell even add a pages messenger in the app where it even has the bubble. add some crazy stuff and give me a real reason to have the appEDIT:1/23/2020 still no real reason to have it....",0.131
It was supposed to replace pages manager. As it turns out you can only manage one page and even that is terrible.,0.129
I am not a fan of this app messaging makes it very difficult to communicate with customers because you're doing it twice almost. And if you don't pay attention you will miss messages because sometimes they don't come through. Secondly I don't like the format but that's just me.,0.129
When I originally downloaded this app it was great! Always notified me of comments and messages but over the past year it's stopped doing that! I'm now always missing messages and comments so replying late to customers. My notifications are on iv checked. Its a complete waste of time this app now for me. I have to constantly self check my page for updates on messages and comments.,0.129
"Convenient for those who don't always have a PC available, but messages sent to the inbox NEVER seem to appear on the mobile app. Refreshing does nothing. I'll get a notification of the message, go to check it, and it won't appear. Super frustrating as it inhibits my ability to respond and then lowers my response time.",0.129
"I got Business Suite to help me manage my Facebook business page. But thanks to recent updates, it's become an aggravating, useless tool. The worst thing is that I'm not being notified of direct messages.

I also don't understand why Facebook decided to remove the date and timestamp from those messages, along with our ability to see commentors' profiles.",0.128

This app will not and has not allowed me to post pictures for at least a year. My phone is not old and this app is solely responsible for losing business as I cannot advertise. Please stop trying to fix things that aren't broken. The original pages manager app worked fine and didn't take so long to upload anything. This app has become muddy and inefficient. You used to be able to post pictures and statuses no problem. Not whatever this is.,0.126
Just downloaded the app and oh my God is it messed up. The main page just keeps spamming reload and if you don't time it right you can't move around the app. Once it's fixed I'll raise the rating.,0.126

Can't see the date/time of posts, if post is too long and has a ""see more"" link, when you click on it you can't see anything that was written, let alone the additional text. If you click on someone who commented or reacted you can't see their FB profile page anymore. You can't see who shared a post. And I'm still constantly having to force stop the app so it will fully load. Congratulations, you made it worse without making anything better.",0.125
"What happened to the away message? It doesn't send. I also don't seem to be able to change what time periods it sends out.

"I can't invite customers who like my posts to like my page, the invite button is there but when you click nothing happens. Also, you can not upload more than 3 pictures with a post. Sometimes notifications are there and sometimes they are not. Definitely would prefer to switch back to pages manager app. Please fix the glitches! You are a multi million dollar company, I don't see why these things are not taken care of!!!!!",0.124
It's a problem for business! It randomly starts working and it doesn't show my messages. How can I have bookings if I can't even read any messages? This app is worst than pages manager! The only thing I like is how it's connected to my Fb page and IG page. I can use the app for both platforms.,0.123
I feel the suite is not user friendly. The look of the pages are a bit much. I would rather it be separate.,0.122
"Inconvenience it absolutely does not make posting to a page easier. In fact it makes things twice as complicated as it wants to constantly post in different locations/platforms. Wants to turn everything into a useless Instagram video. Posts out of sequence, omits post details. FB needs to stop over complicating things by trying to reinvent the wheel.",0.122

"Please STOP updating this app! Every time you do, it messes things up. I scheduled posts for Facebook and Instagram tonight and the ""best times"" suggestions are back, separate ones for each platform this time. What a mess! Instagram scheduled, Facebook isn't showing up at all...but I learned from last time that doesn't mean it's not going to post. Tags don't work. Reach is almost non-existent. You want businesses to pay for ads, but that's not much better!",0.121
"New updates make almost everything more streamline. Definitely easier to see and respond to comments and interact with your audience. switching between pages is easy.

When I create a post for Instagram the tags don't actually get posted. It happens almost Everytime and my main use is to schedule posts. I feel like the companies own so e should be better than third party ones but it really isn't great. I get a million notifications because it hits all platforms and I have dug but can't figure out how to turn off message notifications from a specific platform. It really just isn't great.,0.12
"Since they made the update you can't do anything. Facebook yall need to get it together. People is missing out on customers, because the invite button don't work.

PLEASE FIX, IM MISSING OUT ON MONEY BECAUSE OF YALL MISTAKES",0.119
"This app works well for scheduling posts across multiple pages for both Facebook and Instagram. HOWEVER, it only seems to work in Portrait mode on the tablet which is really annoying as I tend to use my tablet like a laptop with a bluetooth keyboard witch is landscape mode. This means that whenever I switch to this app, I'm viewing it sideways. Like I said, really annoying.",0.119

A message will come to the inbox say ""customer name to desserts by Danna: and then preview the message but not give it in its entirety"" there is no easy trick I've come across to get it to finish recieving the msg. It's frustrating, and wastes my time. Also I'd like to opt out of this new calendar scheduling option. It auto pops up, and is a distraction. Outside of that using it for years, it's cool.",0.117

"it is not user friendly - has errors, does not save updated information & the platform is not directly connected to the FB app, causing you to use this ""business suite"" which in ny opinion offers nothing special outside of analytics... more storage space now being used on my phone, another platform the business now HAS to use/learn & we would rather just disconnect from Facebook & send all traffic to our websites & public chat forums so FB doesn't continue to document & notated all of our work",0.112

"It helps, but certainly not the best it could be. Personally I do not see much of a difference of using Facebook app, then selecting to go to my Page & make updates versus having an app, taking up additional space on my phone, other than the fact that it takes you directly to your page. 1)There is not a reoccurring appointment feature, which causes so many issues with scheduling. 2)Alerts are barely received for incoming contact.3) Error with uploading & updating content & posts.",0.092
"I enjoy using this app to post to my business profile but I wish there was a MARK AS READ button available IN the mobile notification bar. It's annoying to have to click on each individual message for the app to mark it as read. Some messages do not need that much attention, but I feel it's just another way for Facebook to force you to open the app and try to suck you in.",0.092
It's ridiculous I've had to uninstall and install the app again in order for the notifications to go away. It also runs slow and does not show my profile picture or cover photo clearly. I do not want to keep reinstalling the app. The notifications still get stuck and show that I have unseen notifications yet I have already seen them.,0.092

important app but much missing. - Can't load photos from ANY album on my phone! only from Gallery - tagging needs fixing - why can't I do simple album management on my pages with any of Facebook apps?

It doesn't save any of my post and then I'll have to retype the entire post. I manage several FB pages for work and this is getting almost impossible to use on mobile.",0.09

I just get on my personal Facebook for a little bit, then get back on this app and it usually let's me update a little more before locking me out again. I wish they could fix that problem as wel",0.083
I like being able to post on Facebook and Instagram at the same time. It saves time. What doesn't save time is creating a post and scheduling it just to have the post not show up in my scheduled feed! Super annoying to have to recreate the same post multiple times. Please fix this glitch!,0.083

I don't know why they make it so hard and how they spam you through the messenger app,0.082
Lot of bugs and sometimes delay in messages showing up but you get the notification you just can't see the message in app. Also you cannot reply via notification bar. It says sent but never sends . So you got mad customers that you replied to but never received it until you figure out you can quickly reply via notification bar or have to wait to see message because the app won't display it.,0.082

"it very simple to use even though not all the instagram features are available given that you can't tag directly in the photo the utility of the tag suggestions is good. the only thing that should be fixed is that when you want to program your stories with a gif of any kind there's no way to do it, the disposition to schedule is only to pictures alone.",0.057
"UPDATED REVIEW: I'm very pleased with the updates to this app and use it all the time. Original post: Takes forever to post video. The latest ""upgrade"" made my messages disappear and keeps displaying the same notifications, even though I've already read and responded to them. Now my personal and business accounts all run together, which is pointless for me. I don't know what happened. This app used to be great, but with every update, it sucks a little more.",0.056
"It's easy to use, makes managing both apps in one place easy. One of the best apps I've used that makes managing tasks with social media accounts seamless. It's a no brainer.",0.056
It's okay. Nice to have all the messages in one spot but it doesn't alert you in real time when you have a message. It often says read messages are new. Days later it will pop up as a new message.,0.056
"Sometimes little quirks, like app not functional when choosing option directly from ""share"" feature. Not efficient to be unable to edit a scheduled post; as a social media page admin for work, I need to be able to work on the go.",0.056
"very very poorly developed app with zero attention, a lot of bugs and not very intuitive at all, bawic options put in very weird places and options that are rarely used put in very obvious places.. i would appreciate if they give the users the option to edit the buttons down in the toolbar or at least put a drop down box that users can customize what button they want to have in there.",0.055
"I manage an american legion post. We rely on Facebook. The 2 problems I have that I keep contacting them for (have never received a response) is that I can't pin a post from the app. I have to go to a desktop to do that. Other thing is that my location will not come up when making a post. A sub page in our organization appears and yes you guessed it, they haven't responded to that either. They want you to spend money but they won't help you with what is needed.",0.055
The recent update (9/26) prohibits me from seeing what our posters are saying. I see a post come through but can't see what it says. Seriously setting us back on our page and how we function as a business.,0.055
"Latest update HORRIBLE. Before, I would need to tap an article or image TWICE before it would upload. The Latest upload, SIX times, and the window still didn't indicate an upload. Luckily, my phone has a sound notification, and when I heard that and checked ny Facebook page, the image had uploaded. Otherwise, I'd have spammed my clients with multiple postings! C'mon developer(s), you can do better! One star until fixed!",0.055
"I love it except for one thing...it always says I have one Instagram message. I don't! I've looked in every possible folder, unread, spam...nothing. It drives me crazy because it feels like a customer is going unanswered. Fix this Facebook/Instagram creators!",0.055
"Great app! Currently having trouble viewing my inbox. It says that I'm not connected to the Internet but I definitely am. Also it was telling me I have two unread messages even though all my messages were read. I think some of my new messages aren't coming through, maybe I need to empty my inbox? I uninstalled the app and reinstalled it also restarted my phone. Still not working, this needs to be fixed.",0.054
might be helpful if Facebook took you here when you try to access your page. instead Facebook just looses the plot an tries to search for something,0.054
The app has been helpful with my business page overall but am not receiving notifications of messages & am unable to read/reply to them. Also the post scheduling has been removed which has taken away a big tool that was incredibly useful for my page. I'll try to deal with it a bit longer but this is ridiculous.,0.053
"This app is so outdated. My ""recent posts"" are from over a year ago. (Tried deleting and redownloading and that didn't help) How am I supposed to use this as my main way to interact on my business page from my phone when it is outdated and not user friendly?",0.053
Many times notifications are VERY delayed which can affect business. navigation thru this app as opposed to going to my business page thru the facebook app differs as well. i have also found that many followers do not even see things I have posted. hopefully the update will work out these kinks.,0.053

"A decent way to connect to your customers, but different parts of it decide not to work at different times. The comments may not load, the notifications tab is often empty despite saying that there are comments or reactions on a post, the list of likes is often blank, regardless of how many there are. The Facebook family of sites and apps often falls short of my expectations, and were it not almost a necessity for small businesses, I would drop them altogether to pursue other avenues of outreach",0.053
Only works about half the time. Still sends me to the page using browser to make some changes. Maybe its my phone. Meh 3 stars,0.053
There seems to be a lot of crossover and repetitiveness with the Facebook and Instagram apps. It seems like it would be easier if it could all be done right within Facebook or Instagram rather than a separate Pages app. I often lose messages having a check so many different sources.,0.052
There are certain issues that needs to fixed. Not getting updated in real time. When i get a notification and tap on it. I should directed to the latest activity. But i end up on a white screen. And black screen with no comments. So everytime I have to go back to the browser and check those activities,0.052
"There are times when I never get a notification for a message from a customer, or i will get a notification hours after the message was received. I cannot see all comments on posts because it is automatically set to most relevant, and even when i switch to all comments, it will not show them all. This app could use work. Update 10/4/2020 - This app is still awful. tell me why i can get your dumb ads to load in 4k but not my business messages?",0.052
"No notifications. I thought that was the point of a separate app, to be notified of there's a message or comment. I get notified multiple times that I can 6000 people within 15 miles if I buy an ad. There are about 60 people living in that area.",0.051
"When posting from Facebook, to Page Manager, the app often fails to load, so I can post whatever I have found. Second try sometimes works, sometimes does not work. The NV I end up having to open the app and try to do my post from the platform, instead of from the post I need to share..",0.051
"Almost never works. I can't upload pictures with out getting errors, but if you go to Instagram and share it to the Facebook page it post perfectly.",0.051
"Difficult to use, can't use in landscape mode. Facebook has created so many different apps to manage your business page and none of them are user friendly. It was much better when you could create and schedule posts directly from your page.",0.05
"The app was fantastic until a month ago, and the update messed it up. They then updated it once a week for about five weeks, yet it still was not working, so tonight I decided to uninstall and reinstall the app, and bam! It works again!",0.05
"I use it often. It servrs a great purpose, but it gets stuck too often. Takes forever to reset. When it works, I can easily manage several pages quickly. It should allow you to post to main page with ease, but it does not.",0.05

"this app was my favorite for years. However, lately it will not show me my new messages unless I open and close it several times. I'm not very techy, though, so it could be a phone issue. I'm hoping this update solves the problem. Otherwise, great app!",0.049
"This has been mostly useful, but in the last week or so my notifications stopped showing up. I'm able to see that I have notifications, but when I click on the icon the page is just blank. I've even tried deleting and reinstalling the app, but still the same problem... Please fix this!!",0.049
It's could be better but as of right now only complaint I have is when I get a message and go to the app message tab the new message isn't there I do have to refresh it but it usually pops up after it refreshes but I like the app it has gotten me alot of business,0.049
"Good, excellent rather. It makes the business profile to look so professional. Been having problems with setting billing issues but it works alright now. But cannot upload pictures directly from gallery onto the App",0.048
"The worst Facebook app I have ever used. It won't upload videos; also it does not list every picture of my photo gallery. However, if you manage to go through all challenges while uploading pictures or videos , it will only leave about 1 cm room on your screen to scroll down to review your text... and I have a large screen on my phone. Absolutely garbage app. But of course the Boost function works perfectly...",0.048
"After the last update nothing works or loads. When I post it never shows me it has posted I have to manually check to make sure. My recent posts will not load on the home page, I am still seeing last months posts on the top. I have reached out to tech support but no reply or change.",0.048
"Same as all the other reviews on this update. No notifications, messages appear 3 days late. Trying to manage a pumpkin patch, in October, and this is completely sidelining our communication with customers via Facebook and Instagram, immediately following an ad campaign on those platforms. Just peachy.",0.048
Lags big time when sending notifications. a lot of times I have to manually open the app and make sure that I didn't miss any recent messages. Many times it will all of a sudden send me all of my notifications at once and my phone goes off like 20 times in a row.,0.047
"It use to work great, then it wouldn't give me option to load pictures or respond to my messages. I had to uninstall the app and re-install the app and it works. So any having problems with it after the update, try re-installing it. Hopefully it works for you. Best of luck!",0.047
"This app started out great. The only problem was with not getting notifications for scheduled appointments. It wasn't a big deal as I opted to get text alerts for scheduled appointments. Lately it has gotten worse. I am not able to schedule in the app--appointments or 'personal events'--or change my business hours. Fortunately, I can still do that via webpage, but it's not as convenient. This app started out so helpful for my business, but now I'm considering other options.",0.047
"I'd say it is the worst app for business. Watching the insights and statistics is great for, yes, but I can do the same on the pc when I need it. But the app needs to be responsive to customer comments and msgs quick. Instead it chooses where & when to notify and where not as well as notifying of the old messages I responded already. And now, as of November I can't see any customer reviews (only the beginning of it on notifications), nor the time & date of my posts! Wish I didn't have to use it.",0.047
actually the application is a good one but it sometimes freezes and does not load messages. Can you do fix the bugs on this application?,0.046
Over all this app makes it easier to keep up with any or all your pages at once. The only reason I didnt give it five stars is because it never let's me know when someone comments or shares a post till days after. This causes problems with keeping the post viable to more Facebook followers.,0.046
"I've used this to help me expand on my handmade products business. Marketing for my Etsy shop. I've reached a decent few customers wih the ads I was able to make with the app. I haven't had any issues with it, yet. All issues I've had have literally been just from using a messed up phone cutting off on me, but i was able to correct them quickly.",0.045
"I dont get notifications about interactions, the posts on my page are over a month out of date on this app, it doesn't update my page when I interact with commentors or make posts via the app. This thing is about useless other than it is the only way on mobile I can do certain edits and see insights....when it wants to work.",0.045
"While this is a helpful app, The notifications are annoying! I can't get rid of unread notifications although I've clicked them all. It's funny this happened ever since I opted out of the constant notifications about boosting my posts. 🤔 So it's either get multiple of those boost posts daily or keep ""unread"" notifications 🤦🏾‍♀️",0.045
"The application is not terrible, but there are a few items that need to be addressed. One thing is the notifications, for one they don't always come through, and the other is that even after you've read all the messages the app still shows that you have unread messages. This is very frustrating since being a business page you want to respond to messages quickly, you are constantly checking the app to make sure you don't have new messages. Guess I'm out of room, please fix above issues.",0.045
Almost works!! I scheduled a bunch of instagram posts that had captions when i scheduled them...but business suite posted without the captions. So i had to delete everything and repost it all which defeats the purpose of scheduling. This app could be super helpful if it actually worked.,0.045
"This app is both super helpful and frustrating. I wish it would have a calender set-up that can be drilled down on, for scheduling posts. That way I could see what days have enough, too many or not enough posts scheduled, without having to scroll forever. I do love being able to schedule posts and track stats!!",0.045
UPDATE: This issue has been fixed! A good app until recently. The new update took away the ability to like comments on posts and no longer get notifications. Have to refresh in order to show new comments and notifications. Please fix this issue.,0.044
"I like the way pages manager lets me know when someone is commenting or liking something on my pages. However, I think there might a gliche in the system since all but one of my pages is listed and all the messages for the missing page shows up on one of the others the app recognizes.  Otherwise, this review would be a 5 star rating.",0.044
"This is a very capable app, though it seems a bit buggy. On the plus side, I can post to both Facebook and Instagram simultaneously, which is great, and I can see our engagement and reply to comments. On the minus side, different parts of the app display posts differently, in unexpected ways, such as showing the picture without its caption or showing reactions but giving an error message in place of showing the post at all.",0.044
"Ehh, I more so use it because I have to. It doesn't do a good job of updating across platforms. If I answer a comment in the IG app, it's still in this one. It also needs more concise navigation to clearly access and address each account. I also rarely get notifications. Maybe the update will fix it.",0.044
"I am in the early stages of learning Pages and have not reached the intermitent stage. Therefore, I gave the Application 4 stars because so far i like how it keeps things structured for me. However, I seem to be spending alot of trying trying to figure it out. It doesn't seem user friendly. I am working through how much of my not understanding has to do with me or if it's the Application. I like easy access where I can quickly see how to navigate. Thank you.",0.044
"I like being able to manage my page from the app, but I feel there are many things I cannot do from it after the recent updates - I lost the ability to like a comment, I can only reply. I also can't respond as myself, only as the page. overall a good app, but it needs to expand its capabilities, not decrease them!",0.044
- Won't $how notifications by app icon or notifiy when - App will show notifications by the business name but after you click on it then nothing. There is a lot of advertising going on which is making it very difficult to keep wanting to continue to navigate through all the ads and actual customer feedback. I don't get a lot of feedback or engamgement so it is easy... Also making it obvious how many ads facebook is $ending. I'll $pend more money if you $pend less...,0.044
"Listen this is a great app, but every single time I ope. And try to use it it Continously glitches am lags. It keeps reloading starting me back at the top of my page. Ive tried Uninstalling the application and installing it back it did my work. So if you guys at FB could please fix this glitch that would be fantastic. Thanks",0.044
Just updated. It's not allowing me to add a photo to a specific album.... Please change it back. Update 6/17/21....just updated.. No changes have been made to get it back to its original format.....6/26/21..uprated app. Back in working order. Thanks to whom ever fixed it ⚒️❤️,0.044

very helpful if you want to run or start a business. some things i don't like. the constant updating. another. things get posted multiple times or not at all. sometimes it freezes up. & yiy you can't get messages when people send them. otherwise its good & it great its a free if want start your own site. & you do have creative freedom.,0.043
I wish the messages were dated. All messages in a thread just run together no matter what day they were sent. Also wish you could take payments in the app. I like that Instagram and Facebook can be combined and you can do the same post at once.,0.043
"This is a handy tool for when I have to step AFK during the work day for a few hours. However, I receive notifications for my own comments on my page's ads, and it's maddening.

Helps keep me appointments in order but i noticed recently the private note stopped saving. Also not all the contacts save and i cant click on the number and it call it from the app like it used to. 😒 was way better before the name change.,0.043
App will not let me schedule posts in advance no matter what time I choose. It says it can't be within 20 minutes or over 75 days from making it but I'm well within the guidelines.,0.043
It takes too long to show a message & notification.And the auto save reply suggestion in the inbox is really annoying.Like I sent a message and then it'll float right in front of the keyboard all the time saying save it as an auto reply.Sometimes I click on it mistakenly becuase it's always there and the situation gets weird because the message is totally different than what I'll say.If anyone wanna save anything they'll save it by their own.Also the main feed doesn't load.Add the review option.,0.042
It doesn't notify you of your messages most of the time and now it has gotten to where it won't show the new messages even when it dies tell you there is one. I have to go to my computer to be able to read them. I have lost some work due to these issues.,0.042
The only complaint is there needs to be an option on mobile to switch from page role to personal account so I could then share the content of the business page to my personal account without having to access a laptop or desk top. Other wise awesome.,0.041

this app is convenient to post to both Facebook and Instagram at the same time. but some things don't sync properly so you can click on notifications in three different places just to get them to clear. and try to build an inventory or catalog wow it's so difficult. even the template that I downloaded from there you have to have all these links to pictures and this and that on the template it takes less time to just type the information into Facebook.,0.04
There are glitches with receipt and responses of messages! There is no ability to turn off messages from individuals without blocking as spam. The events that I created were there one day and gone the next! I do NOT understand why there has to be another app to manage a page!!!!,0.04

I miss the old pages app. I don't like the way comments and conversations aren't separated. When I need to refer back to a conversation from a clients original message about an order I have to scroll and scroll through everyday comments and emojis. I thought this would be easier having Instagram and fb clients blended together but for me it's just more time searching and I can't find just my fb clients through the mass amounts of ♥️ and 👍.,0.038

App is great except for the delayed messages. Even when you refresh the app or close it out and open it back up again. The messages are not synced. Otherwise we use this everyday for our business. Once bugs are fixed I would be more than willing to give 5 stars.,0.036
I like that it combines my business page with Instagram. I dislike that I get notifications for messages and then the messages take a long time to finally show up when I open the app. I'll get a notification that I have a message but then can't find that message in the app u til hours later.,0.036

"I can't click ""add picture"" on my main page & select the album that I want it to post to anymore. Most of my posts are products I've made & sell, this is extremely annoying. The workaround is to go several screens deep to my photo albums & add the photo directly to the album there. The previous process used to be much simpler (similar to when you post a status with a picture on Facebook and select what album you want to upload to). Notifications (ie: comments & msgs) are unreliable.",0.035
"Its a great app but when I'm on it, I can't see any of my posts and if I click ""see more"" it just shows the picture and no text. Nothing is time stamped either.

Overall pretty sasified. I wish the page editing was a little bit easier but other than that pretty good.

"I like the fact that you are able to view messages from both instagram and facebook accounts. There are a couple of bugs I would like to see fixed in the future... 1.)

Then I go to the messages and I have to refresh several times before it will pop up.",0.032
So I was very happy about the fact that everything is merge together into one app. I was even more excited that I was able to add product to my shop from my phone.

"I have 3 issues with this apple ; 1. There's no option for Dark theme. (I mean, c'mon, everything looks cooler with a dark theme) 2. It's slow. It lags and takes long to load pages (I don't know if it's my phone but other apps on my phone run smoothly) 3. The saved replies are too slow to use. On instagram, when you type the short version of your saved reply, something pops up promoting you to click and get the full message before you then hit send. That's cool and faster. Make it like that.",0.032

I had to disable the book now button because it caused more issues than it helped. Created more work for me.

It seems to be a lot is your 2 years and going to all the different other options that are not in one place and still basically learning how to use it and I still haven't started using it regularly that's the problem I have to get used to using regularly then I'm sure I will begin to reap all the benefits 5 you are new additions to this app. I will make you a commitment that I am going to attempt to work with it daily to get the full benefit of the software updates that you have made.,0.027
I cant make this up my recent posts tab hasnt updated since april 1st. 5 whole months it hasnt kept track of my posts. This app has removed so many important features from the original app and has so many bugs.

You cant view where people have mentioned your page. Its just an all around mess.,0.027

This is helpful for marketing on a business page or seeing stats on your posts.

"When I received a question or quilt request with ""Pages Manager"" I got a notification [from FB Manager], clicked on it, and I was sent straight to my customer's message. Now I get a notification, click on it, and it goes nowhere. I have to go into the app and hunt around for the message. Yesterday: I wasn't notified of a message from Thursday afternoon until late Friday morning. By then they could have moved on to someone else who makes t-shirt quilts because some people want immediate answers - especially when they've lost a loved one and want a memory quilt. They figure that if you can't answer their questions promptly then you won't make their quilt in a timely manner either. Fortunately, once I get to my pages everything is still the way it was (so far) which made navigation easy once I finally received the notification. On my Blessing Box page a speedy answer is important because some people message for help paying utility bills or needing food. [Especially in the winter] prompt notification is extremely important. I'm not a fan of the gap between receiving a message and being 'told' that I received a message.",0.024

So far I enjoy it and only gave it 3 stars because I think it asks you to rate the app way too early. I've had it installed less than an hour and you want me to rate my experience? Just think about that 🤔 Why not set an in app timer hidden by code and ask after they use it for a day or two but only in app or two. Realistically they would get the message in about a week or twos worth of IRL time and that would be a way better rating scale. So I'll review this in 2 wk's time. Sorry.,0.014

"Pretty great and simplistic UI, and easy to access multiple pages quickly. The only issue I'm having is that it won't show me comments sometimes.

I've come to rely on the ability to differentiate between my Instagram posts and Facebook posts in tags and specifications for the needs of the different audiences, and the app doesn't have that nuance (that I could see!).

Love the business suite app. Just wish I could schedule a post and share it to my other groups at the same time. It said I would have to remove other groups if I wanted to post in the future😥 So guess what I did....I left it open and went to bed and posted it in the morning. BUT... that doesn't work for 3 days out. It would really clean up mind clutter trying to remember to go share scheduled posts 😎,0.0
The app is nice but it needs lot of corrections. 1. It does not provide space for video title 2. Does not update new messages immediately 3. Very slow operation 4. Declines some schedule posts It will be a better app if it's functioning properly.,0.0
